# Part 4: Next.js + Codespaces + GitHub Pages

In this lab you'll build a full-fledged Next.js website using GitHub Codespaces, GitHub Pages, and GitHub Actions.

1. Go to [https://github.com/codespaces/templates](https://github.com/codespaces/templates) and select `Next.js`. This opens a new Codespace with a fully built out Next.js template and running development server.
2. Right now, this Codespace is not attached to a repo. Select the version control tab and click `Publish Branch`. This prompts you to create a private or public repo. You can change the name of the repo by editing the text in the text field.
